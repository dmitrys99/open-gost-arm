OpenGOST is a sans-serif font for technical lettering complying standards **GOST 2.304** and **ISO 3098**, with support 
for Latin, Cyrillic and Greek character sets. This font extends the charset by Armenian block
with sufficient characters for U+0530 through U+058F.

This font is distributed under [Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/OFL).
It permits the font to be used, modified, and distributed freely (as long as the resulting fonts remain under the **Open Font License**).

Author of the initial range of Latin, Cyrillic and Greek blocks is Nikita Volchenkov.
For more information see [FONTLOG.txt](FONTLOG.txt).

## Disclaimer

- As long as standards **ISO 3098** and **GOST 2.304** generally define charsets for Latin, Cyrillic and Greek alphabets,
and there is no any standard for Armenian glyphs of technical lettering, this font could be considered as a custom superset of mentioned standards.


- Only Regular types (A, B) are included, Italic charset is yet to be done.


- Please not, that any modifications applied to this font must meet requirements of both **ISO 3098** and **GOST 2.304** standards
  (it would be better not to modify anything out of the Armenian block scope, except fixes).
